# Under Development

The project is in early stage of development so code is unorganized and bug ridden.

## About Zinker

Zinker is a laravel code runner application. It's kind of like a poorman's Tinkerwell with lot less feature and a web app instead of a desktop app.

## Why

First of all [Just For Fun, Really!!!](https://justforfunnoreally.dev)

I build this for my own need. I often need to run some code in an app and don't want drop in a terminal and use tinker. While Tinkerwell is an excellent app I prefer using browser over desktop app and also I don't need all the features it provides. There is also `laravel-web-tinker` package by `spatie` but I don't want to install that in every project and also can't use it in clients project so I decided to make Zinker. Zinker is a very hacky solution so it's quite limited in its capability but it does the job for my need.

## Setup

Currently this works on valet.

Install like a regular laravel app.


## Features

Features I intend to add in future

[x] Run php code

[x] Run code on any laravel application

[x] See all the query log of your code

[] See date time format and iterate on key shortcut

[] See model/collection data in table

[] Filtering and searching function for table data

[] Raw SQL to Eloquent query
